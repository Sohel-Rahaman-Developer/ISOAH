From turmeric lattes to CBD-infused teas, the herbal market promises everything from better sleep to clearer skin. But beneath the glossy packaging and influencer endorsements, it pays to understand how (and why) these plants work. In this beginner’s guide to herbal wellness, we’ll walk through five of the most researched herbs—chamomile, echinacea, ashwagandha, ginger, and peppermint—covering their traditional uses, active compounds, and what modern science says about their efficacy.</p>
              <p>Next, we’ll dive into how to choose high-quality herbal products: what certifications to look for, how to decode labels, and red flags to avoid (like proprietary blends and exaggerated health claims). Whether you’re brewing your first cup of hibiscus tea or shopping for your first bottle of elderberry extract, these tips will help you sift through marketing hype and choose herbs that are both safe and evidence-backed.</p>`,
